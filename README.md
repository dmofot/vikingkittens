=============

This is one of the first Flash music videos from 2002 that helped to launch the "viral" video genre.  Created by Joel Veitch, it has long since disappeared from [rathergood.com](http://rathergood.com), possibly due to some threatened litigation.  So here it is in all it's glory, Viking Kittens set to Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song.
